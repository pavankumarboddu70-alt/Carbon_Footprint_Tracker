## Chapter 2: Literature Survey  

### 2.1 Existing Systems  
- Tools like Pawprint, JouleBug, and Carbonfootprint.com exist.  
- Most are commercial or region-specific.  

### 2.2 Research Gaps  

#### 2.2.1 Missing Features  
1. *Customizability*: Few systems tailor calculations to local data.  
2. *Offline Capability*: Most solutions require continuous internet.  
3. *Model Transparency*: Calculations are often black-box.  
4. *Visualization*: Limited use of clear, interactive charts.  

#### 2.2.2 Summary Table  
| Feature               | Existing Tools     | Ideal Goal     | Gap        |
|-----------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------|
| Personalization       | Partial            | Full           | Moderate   |
| Offline Usability     | Rare               | Yes            | High       |
| Open-source Access    | Rare               | Required       | High       |
| Visual Reports        | Basic Pie Charts   | Rich Interactivity | High  |

## Chapter 4: Implementation

### 4.1 Phase 1 (Completed)
#### UI & Data Preprocessing
- Designed the homepage with structured input forms
- Created intuitive sections: *Personal Info, Travel, Energy, Waste, Food*
- Sidebar layout implemented for smooth user navigation
- Performed *data cleaning, normalization*, and missing value handling
- Conducted *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*:
  - Visualized distribution of carbon contributors
  - Identified high-emission patterns across user categories

### 4.2 Phase 2 (Completed)
#### Model Training
- Used preprocessed data to train a Machine Learning model
- Model predicts *annual carbon footprint (in tons CO₂e)* based on user inputs
- Covered main domains: *Travel, Electricity, Food, Waste*
- Evaluated performance using metrics like *R² score, MAE*
- Tuned hyperparameters for optimal accuracy

### 4.3 Phase 3 (Upcoming)
